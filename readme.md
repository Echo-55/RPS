# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
## Description
Good ole rock, paper, scissors - but with a twist! It's rock vs paper vs scissors. The three teams will start with 20 members each. They will start spread out accross the map.
At the beginning of each round, every sprite will move in a random direction. If they collide with another sprite, they will fight. The winner will gain a member from the loser's team. The loser will lose a member. If a sprite collides with a wall, they will deflect off of it. The game ends when there is only one team remaining.
At the beginning of each round, the player will be able to choose which team they think will be the winner. If they are correct, they will gain a point. If they are incorrect, they will lose a point. The player will be able to see their score at the top of the screen.
